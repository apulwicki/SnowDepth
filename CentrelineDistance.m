% Calculating the distance of all raster points from the centreline 
%       This script finds the smallest distance between all sampled point 
%       and all points in a raster from the glacier centreline (drawn by 
%       hand in QGIS). 
%
%       Inputs:         centrelinepoints.csv (from QGIS)
%       Outputs:        topo_full.(G).centreD
