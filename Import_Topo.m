% Importing Topographic Data
%       This script imports topographic data that was exported from QGIS.
%       It imports the DEMs (ratser) as well as the values of topographic
%       parameters at each sampling location (found in QGIS). It also
%       creates a standardized set of params (to be used in MLR for
%       relevant coefficients) as well as a true value set (for plotting).
%
%       Inputs:         GlacierTopos/*, 'SPOT_TopoParams_noZZ.xlsx'
%       Outputs:        Snowdepth structure (SD)
%                       Elevations from GPS WPs (gps_elev)
